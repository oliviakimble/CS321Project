     The problem with the time and complexity of shift management in businesses with 
     large numbers of employees, unhappy employees due to disorganized scheduling. 
     Other employee management systems do not place the level of focus that we do on

    easy-to-read format. It essentially allows them to view any piece of information about 
    any number of employees in an overlaid style/cumulative format. An example would be if 
    managers wanted to view all employees with a particular job title and view all of their 
    week-to-week availabilities at once.
